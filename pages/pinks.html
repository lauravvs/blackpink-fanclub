            Snowdrop takes place in 1987, a pivotal year in South Korean history
            that included the June 1987 Democracy Movement, a mass protest
            movement with the purpose of forcing the dictatorship in South Korea
            to hold fair elections, and the resulting December 1987 democratic
            elections, which led to the end of the authoritarian Fifth Republic
            of Korea and the establishment of the democratic Sixth Republic of
            Korea. Snowdrop is set in November and December 1987. Lim Soo-ho
            (Jung Hae-in) plays a graduate student who is found covered in blood
            by Eun Yeong-ro (Jisoo), a female university student and hides him
            from the government in her dorm room. However, it is revealed that
            Soo-ho is not who he appears to be. Against the backdrop of
            political upheaval, the pair's story unfolds and the two develop a
            romantic relationship.
